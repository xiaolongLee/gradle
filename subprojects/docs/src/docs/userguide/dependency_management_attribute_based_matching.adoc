[[attribute_based_matching]]
= Attribute based matching in dependency resolution

This chapter is primarily aimed towards plugin authors who want to understand better how to leverage the capabilities of the dependency resolution engine to support variant-aware dependency management.
Users who simply want to understand what configuration attributes are will also find support here.

[[sec:abm_configuration_kinds]]
== Different kinds of configurations

Historically, <<managing_dependency_configurations.adoc#sub:what_is_a_configuration,configurations>>  have been at the root of dependency resolution in Gradle.
In the end, what we want to make a difference is between a _consumer_ and a _producer_. For this purpose, configurations are used for at least 3 different aspects:

1. to declare dependencies
2. as a _consumer_, to resolve a set of dependencies to files
3. as a _producer_, to expose artifacts for consumption by other projects

For example, if I want to express that my application `app` _depends on_ library `lib`, we need _at least_ one configuration:

.Configurations are used to declare dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare-configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-configuration]"]
====

Configurations can extend other configuration, in order to inherit their dependencies.
However, the code above doesn't tell anything about the _consumer_.
In particular, it doesn't tell what is the _use_ of the configuration.
Let's say that `lib` is a Java library: it can expose different things, such as its API, implementation or test fixtures.
If we want to resolve the dependencies of `app`, we need to know what kind of task we're performing (compiling against the API of `lib`, executing the application, compiling tests, ...).
For this purpose, you'll often find companion configurations, which are meant to unambiguously declare the usage:

.Configurations representing concrete dependency graphs
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=concrete-classpath]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=concrete-classpath]"]
====

At this stage, we have 3 different configurations, which already have different goals:

- `someConfiguration` declares the dependencies of my application. It's just a bucket where we declare a list of dependencies.
- `compileClasspath` and `runtimeClasspath` are configurations _meant to be resolved_: when resolved they should contain respectively the compile classpath, and the runtime classpath of the application.

This is actually represented on the `Configuration` type by the `canBeResolved` flag.
A configuration that _can be resolved_ is a configuration for which we can compute a dependency graph, because it contains all the necessary information for resolution to happen.
That is to say we're going to compute a dependency graph, resolve the components in the graph, and eventually get artifacts.
A configuration which has `canBeResolved` set to `false` is not meant to be resolved.
Such a configuration is there _only to declare dependencies_.
The reason is that depending on the usage (compile classpath, runtime classpath), it _can_ resolve to different graphs.
It is an error to try to resolve a configuration which has `canBeResolved` set to `false`.
To some extent, this is similar to an _abstract class_ (`canBeResolved`=false) which is not supposed to be instantiated, and a concrete class extending the abstract class (`canBeResolved`=true).
A resolvable configuration will extend at least one non resolvable configuration (and may extend more than one).

On the other end, at the library project side (the _producer_), we also use configurations to represent what can be consumed.
For example, the library may expose an API or a runtime, and we would attach artifacts to either one, the other, or both.
Typically, to compile against `lib`, we need the API of `lib`, but we don't need its runtime dependencies.
So the `lib` project will expose an `apiElements` configuration, which is aimed for consumers looking for its API.
Such a configuration is going to be consumable, but is not meant to be resolved.
This is expressed via the _canBeConsumed_ flag of a `Configuration`:

.Setting up configurations
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=setup-configurations]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=setup-configurations]"]
====

In short, a configuration role is determined by the `canBeResolved` and `canBeConsumed` flag combinations:

.Configuration roles
|===
|Configuration role|can be resolved|can be consumed
|Bucket of dependencies|false|false
|Resolve for certain usage|true|false
|Exposed to consumers|false|true
|Legacy, don't use|true|true
|===

For backwards compatibility, those flags have both `true` as the default value, but as a plugin author, you should always determine the right values for those flags, or you might accidentally introduce resolution errors.

[[sec:abm_configuration_attributes]]
== Configuration attributes

We have explained that we have 3 configuration roles, and explained that we may want to resolve the compile and runtime classpath differently, but there's nothing in what we've written which allows explaining the difference.
This is where _attributes_ come into play.
The role of attributes is to perform the selection of the right _variant_ of a component.
In our example, the `lib` library exposes 2 variants: its API (via `exposedApi`) and its runtime (via `exposedRuntime`).
There's no restriction on the number of variants a component can expose.
We may, for example, want to expose the test fixtures of a component too.
But then, the consumer needs to explain _what_ configuration to consume, and this is done by setting _attributes_ on both the _consumer_ and _producer_ ends.

Attributes consist of a _name_ and a _value_ pair.
Gradle comes with a standard attribute named `org.gradle.usage` specifically to deal with the concept of selecting the right variant of a component based on the usage of the consumer (compile, runtime ...).
It is however possible to define an arbitrary number of attributes.
As a producer, I can express that a consumable configuration represents the API of a component by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to the configuration.
As a consumer, I can express that I need the API of the dependencies of a resolvable configuration by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to it.
Now Gradle has a way to _automatically select the appropriate variant_ by looking at the configuration attributes:

- the consumer wants `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`
- the dependent project exposes 2 different variants. One with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`, the other with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_RUNTIME`.
- Gradle selects the `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API` variant

In other words: attributes are used to perform the selection based on the values of the attributes.
It doesn't matter what the names of the configurations are: only the attributes matter.

[[sec:abm_declaring_attributes]]
== Declaring attributes

Attributes are _typed_. An attribute can be created via the `Attribute<T>.of` method:

.Define attributes
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=define_attribute]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=define_attribute]"]
====

Currently, only attribute types of `String`, or anything extending `Named` is supported.
Attributes must be declared in the _attribute schema_ found on the `dependencies` handler:

.Registering attributes on the attributes schema
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=register-attributes]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=register-attributes]"]
====

Then configurations can be configured to set values for attributes:

.Setting attributes on configurations
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=attributes-on-configurations]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=attributes-on-configurations]"]
====

For attributes which type extends `Named`, the value of the attribute **must** be created via the _object factory_:

.Named attributes
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=named-attributes]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=named-attributes]"]
====

[[sec:abm_compatibility_rules]]
== Attribute compatibility rules

Attributes let the engine select _compatible variants_.
However, there are cases where a provider may not have _exactly_ what the consumer wants, but still something that it can use.
For example, if the consumer is asking for the API of a library, there's a possibility that the producer doesn't have such a variant, but only a _runtime_ variant.
This is typical of libraries published on external repositories.
In this case, we know that even if we don't have an exact match (API), we can still compile against the runtime variant (it contains _more_ than what we need to compile but it's still ok to use).
To deal with this, Gradle provides link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeCompatibilityRule.html[attribute compatibility rules].
The role of a compatibility rule is to explain what variants are _compatible_ with what the consumer asked for.

Attribute compatibility rules have to be registered via the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeMatchingStrategy.html[attribute matching strategy] that you can obtain from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributesSchema.html[attributes schema].

[[sec:abm_disambiguation_rules]]
== Attribute disambiguation rules

Because multiple values for an attribute can be _compatible_ with the requested attribute, Gradle needs to choose between the candidates.
This is done by implementing an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeDisambiguationRule.html[attribute disambiguation rule].

Attribute disambiguation rules have to be registered via the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeMatchingStrategy.html[attribute matching strategy] that you can obtain from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributesSchema.html[attributes schema].

[[sec:abm_artifact_transforms]]
== Transforming dependency artifacts on resolution

As described in <<sec:abm_configuration_kinds,different kinds of configurations>>, there may be different variants for the same dependency.
For example, an external Maven dependency has a variant which should be used when compiling against the dependency (`java-api`), and a variant for running an application which uses the dependency (`java-runtime`).
A project dependency has even more variants, for example the classes of the project which are used for compilation are available as classes directories (`java-api-classes`) or as JARs (`java-api-jars`).

The variants of a dependency may differ in its transitive dependencies or in the artifact itself.
For example, the `java-api` and `java-runtime` variants of a Maven dependency only differ in the transitive dependencies and both use the same artifact - the JAR file.
For a project dependency, the `java-api-classes` and the `java-api-jars` variants have the same transitive dependencies and different artifacts - the classes directories and the JAR files respectively.

Gradle identifies a variant of a dependency uniquely by its set of <<sec:abm_configuration_attributes,attributes>>.
The `java-api` variant of a dependency is the variant identified by the `usage` attribute with value `java-api`.

When Gradle resolves a configuration, the <<sec:abm_configuration_attributes,attributes>> on the resolved configuration determine the _requested attributes_.
For all dependencies in the configuration, the variant with the requested attributes is selected when resolving the configuration.
For example, when the configuration requests `usage=java-api-classes` on a project dependency, then the classes directory is selected as the artifact.

When the dependency does not have a variant with the requested attributes, resolving the configuration fails.
Sometimes it is possible to transform the artifact of the dependency into the requested variant without changing the transitive dependencies.
For example, unzipping a JAR transforms the artifact of the `java-api-jars` variant into the `java-api-classes` variant.
Such a transformation is called _Artifact Transform_.
Gradle allows registering artifact transforms, and when the dependency does not have the requested variant, then Gradle will try to find a chain of artifact transforms for creating the variant.

=== Artifact transform selection and execution

As described above, when Gradle resolves a configuration and a dependency in the configuration does not have a variant with the requested attributes, Gradle tries to find a chain of artifact transforms to create the variant.
The process of finding a matching chain of artifact transforms is called _artifact transform selection_.
Each registered transform converts from a set of attributes to a set of attributes.
For example, the unzip transform can convert from `usage=java-api-jars` to `usage=java-api-classes`.

In order to find a chain, Gradle starts with the requested attributes and then considers all transforms which modify some of the requested attributes as possible paths leading there.
Going backwards, Gradle tries to obtain a path to some existing variant using transforms.

For example, consider a `minified` attribute with two values: `true` and `false`.
The minified attribute represents a variant of a dependency with unnecessary class files removed.
There is an artifact transform registered, which can transform `minified` from `false` to `true`.
When `minified=true` is requested for a dependency, and there are only variants with `minified=false`, then Gradle selects the registered minify transform.
The minify transform is able to transform the artifact of the dependency with `minified=false` to the artifact with `minified=true`.

Of all the found transform chains, Gradle tries to select the best one:

- If there is only one transform chain, it is selected.
- If there are two transform chains, and one is a suffix of the other one, it is selected.
- If there is a shortest transform chain, then it is selected.
- In all other cases, the selection fails and an error is reported.

[NOTE]
====
Gradle does not try to select artifact transforms when there is already a variant of the dependency matching the requested attributes.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `artifactType` attribute is special, since it is only present on resolved artifacts and not on dependencies.
As a consequence, any transform which is only mutating `artifactType` will never be selected when resolving a configuration with only the `artifactType` as requested attribute.
It will only be considered when using an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ArtifactView.html[ArtifactView].
====

After selecting the required artifact transforms, Gradle resolves the variants of the dependencies which are necessary for the initial transform in the chain.
As soon as Gradle finishes resolving the artifacts for the variant, either by downloading an external dependency or executing a task producing the artifact, Gradle starts transforming the artifacts of the variant with the selected chain of artifact transforms.
Gradle executes the transform chains in parallel when possible.

Picking up the minify example above, consider a configuration with two dependencies, the external `guava` dependency and a project dependency on the `producer` project.
The configuration has the attributes `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=true`.
The external `guava` dependency has two variants:

- `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=false` and
- `usage=java-api-jars,minified=false`.

Using the minify transform, Gradle can convert the variant `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=false` of `guava` to `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=true`, which are the requested attributes.
The project dependency also has variants:

- `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=false`,
- `usage=java-runtime-classes,minified=false`,
- `usage=java-api-jars,minified=false`,
- `usage=java-api-classes,minified=false`
- and a few more.

Again, using the minify transform, Gradle can convert the variant `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=false` of the project `producer` to `usage=java-runtime-jars,minified=true`, which are the requested attributes.

When the configuration is resolved, Gradle needs to download the `guava` JAR and minify it.
Gradle also needs to execute the `producer:jar` task to generate the JAR artifact of the project and then minify it.
The downloading and the minification of the `guava.jar` happens in parallel to the execution of the `producer:jar` task and the minification of the resulting JAR.

Here is how to setup the `minified` attribute so that the above works.
You need to register the new attribute in the schema, add it to all JAR artifacts and request it on all resolvable configurations.

.Artifact transform attribute setup
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/minify/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-attribute-setup]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/minify/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-attribute-setup]"]
====
<1> Add the attribute to the schema
<2> All JAR files are not minified
<3> Request `minified=true` on all resolvable configurations
<4> Add the dependencies which will be transformed

You can now see what happens when we run the `resolveRuntimeClasspath` task which resolves the `runtimeClasspath` configuration.
Observe that Gradle transforms the project dependency before the `resolveRuntimeClasspath` task starts.
Gradle transforms the binary dependencies when it executes the `resolveRuntimeClasspath` task.

=== Implementing artifact transforms

Similar to task types, an artifact transform consists of an action and some parameters.
The major difference to custom task types is that the action and the parameters are implemented as two separate classes.

The implementation of the artifact transform action is a class implementing link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformAction.html[TransformAction].
You need to implement the `transform()` method on the action, which converts an input artifact into zero, one or multiple of output artifacts.
Most artifact transforms will be one-to-one, so the transform method will transform the input artifact to exactly one output artifact.

The implementation of the artifact transform action needs to register each output artifact by calling
 link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs:dir(java.lang.Object)[TransformOutputs.dir()] or link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs:file(java.lang.Object)[TransformOutputs.file()].

You can only supply two types of paths to the `dir` or `file` methods:

- An absolute path to the input artifact or in the input artifact (for an input directory).
- A relative path.

Gradle uses the absolute path as the location of the output artifact.
For example, if the input artifact is an exploded WAR, then the transform action can call `TransformOutputs.file()` for all jar files in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory.
The output of the transform would then be the library JARs of the web application.

For a relative path, the `dir()` or `file()` method returns a workspace to the transform action.
The implementation of the transform action needs to create the transformed artifact at the location of the provided workspace.

The output artifacts replace the input artifact in the transformed variant in the order they were registered.
For example, if the configuration consists of the artifacts `lib1.jar`, `lib2.jar`, `lib3.jar`, and the transform action registers a minified output artifact `<artifact-name>-min.jar` for the input artifact, then the transformed configuration consists of the artifacts `lib1-min.jar`, `lib2-min.jar` and `lib3-min.jar`.

Here is the implementation of an `Unzip` transform which transforms a JAR file into a classes directory by unzipping it.
The `Unzip` transform does not require any parameters.
Note how the implementation uses `@InputArtifact` to inject the artifact to transform into the action.
It requests a directory for the unzipped classes by using `TransformOutputs.dir()` and then unzips the JAR file into this directory.

.Artifact transform without parameters
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-unzip]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-unzip]"]
====
<1> Use `TransformParameters.None` if the transform does not use parameters
<2> Inject the input artifact
<3> Request an output location for the unzipped files
<4> Do the actual work of the transform

An artifact transform may require parameters, like a `String` determining some filter, or some file collection which is used for supporting the transformation of the input artifact.
In order to pass those parameters to the transform action, you need to define a new type with the desired parameters.
The type needs to implement the marker interface link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformParameters.html[TransformParameters].
The parameters should be <<lazy_configuration.adoc#sec:lazy_properties,read-only configurable properties>>.
Use an interface declaring the getters and Gradle will generate the implementation.
All getters need to have proper input annotations, see the table in the section on <<more_about_tasks.adoc#table:incremental_build_annotations,incremental build>>.

Here is the implementation of a `Minify` transform that makes JARs smaller by only keeping certain classes in them.
The `Minify` transform requires the classes to keep as parameters.
Observe how you can obtain the parameters by `TransformAction.getParameters()` in the `transform()` method.
The implementation of the `transform()` method requests a location for the minified JAR by using `TransformOutputs.file()` and then creates the minified JAR at this location.

.Minify transform implementation
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/minify/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-minify]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/minify/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-minify]"]
====
<1> Declare the parameter type
<2> Interface for the transform parameters
<3> Use the parameters
<4> Use the unchanged input artifact when not minification is required

Remember that the input artifact is a dependency, which may have its own dependencies.
If your artifact transform needs access to those transitive dependencies, it can declare an abstract getter returning a `FileCollection` and annotate it with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifactDependencies.html[@InputArtifactDependencies].
When your transform runs, Gradle will inject the transitive dependencies into that `FileCollection` property by implementing the getter.
Note that using input artifact dependencies in a transform has performance implications, only inject them when you really need them.

Moreover, artifact transforms can make use of the <<build_cache.adoc#build_cache,build cache>> for their outputs.
To enable the build cache for an artifact transform, add the `@link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/CacheableTransform.html[CacheableTransform]` annotation on the action class.
For cacheable transforms, you must annotate its link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifact.html[@InputArtifact] property — and any property marked with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifactDependencies.html[@InputArtifactDependencies] — with normalization annotations such as link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/PathSensitive.html[@PathSensitive].

The following example shows a more complicated transforms.
It moves some selected classes of a JAR to a different package, rewriting the byte code of the moved classes and all classes using the moved classes (class relocation).
In order to determine the classes to relocate, it looks at the packages of the input artifact and the dependencies of the input artifact.
It also does not relocate packages contained in JAR files in an external classpath.

.Artifact transform for class relocation
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/relocate/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-relocate]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/relocate/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-relocate]"]
====
<1> Declare the transform cacheable
<2> Interface for the transform parameters
<3> Declare input type for each parameter
<4> Declare a normalization for the input artifact
<5> Inject the input artifact dependencies
<6> Use the parameters

=== Registering artifact transforms

You need to register the artifact transform actions, providing parameters if necessary, so that they can be selected when resolving dependencies.

In order to register an artifact transform, you must use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler:registerTransform(java.lang.Class,%20org.gradle.api.Action)[registerTransform()] within the `dependencies {}` block.

There are a few points to consider when using `registerTransform()`:

- The `from` and `to` attributes are required.
- The transform action itself can have configuration options. You can configure them with the `parameters {}` block.
- You must register the transform on the project that has the configuration that will be resolved.
- You can supply any type implementing link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformAction.html[TransformAction] to the `registerTransform()` method.

For example, imagine you want to unpack some dependencies and put the unpacked directories and files on the classpath.
You can do so by registering an artifact transform action of type `Unzip`, as shown here:

.Artifact transform registration without parameters
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
====

Another example is that you want minify JARs by only keeping some `class` files from them.
Note the use of the `parameters {}` block to provide the classes to keep in the minified JARs to the `Minify` transform.

.Artifact transform registration with parameters
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/minify/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/minify/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
====

=== Implementing incremental artifact transforms

Similar to <<custom_tasks#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>, artifact transforms can avoid work by only processing changed files from the last execution.
This is done by using the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges] interface.
For artifact transforms, only the input artifact is an incremental input, and therefore the transform can only query for changes there.
In order to use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges] in the transform action, inject it into the action.
For more information on how to use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges], see the corresponding documentation for <<custom_tasks#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>.

Here is an example of an incremental transform that counts the lines of code in Java source files:

.Artifact transform for lines of code counting
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/incremental/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-countloc]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/incremental/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-countloc]"]
====
<1> Inject `InputChanges`
<2> Query for changes in the input artifact
