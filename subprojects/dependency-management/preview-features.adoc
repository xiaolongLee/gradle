# Gradle 5.0 Feature Previews

## New Gradle `.module` metadata format

In order to provide rich support for variant-aware dependency management and dependency constraints, Gradle defines a new module metadata format, that can be used in conjunction with Ivy descriptor and Maven POM files in existing repositories.

The new metadata format reached a stable 1.0 with Gradle 5.3.
The latest version of the specification can be found https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/docs/src/docs/design/gradle-module-metadata-1.0-specification.md[here].
Publishing Gradle Module Metadata to public repositories is now possible as Gradle will support format 1.0 going forward.

[NOTE]
Activate this feature in Gradle 4.6+ by adding `enableFeaturePreview("GRADLE_METADATA")` in _settings.gradle(.kts)_.

### Publishing `.module` metadata files

If this feature preview is activated, the _maven-publish_ and _ivy-publish_ plugins automatically publish a `.module` file in addition to the `pom`/`ivy.xml` metadata file.
If these modules are consumed by Gradle, all dependency management features that are published will be honored.
There is no loss of information since no mapping to a less expressive format is required.
By still publishing the traditional metadata formats, compatibility with Maven and Ivy is still ensured as much as possible.

The `.module` files are used to automatically publish the `api` and `runtime` variants of  Java libraries.
These variants are honoured during dependency resolution.
Additional publishing features will be added in the future which will allow for the publication of additional variants.

### Consuming `.module` metadata files

Any Gradle module metadata published with Gradle 5.3 and above will be consumed automatically by Gradle.
This is possible by the creation of a marker in the regular Ivy or Maven metadata files that tell Gradle there is a matching module file.

If this feature preview is activated, Gradle automatically and always searches for a `.module` file for each dependency in a Maven or Ivy repository.
If the file is found, it is preferred over the `pom`/`ivy.xml` file.
Unless you plan on publishing Gradle Module Metadata, you should not enable the feature if the only goal is consumption, as this is transparently covered.

If a `.module` file is found, the full expressiveness of the Gradle feature set is preserved and honored during resolution.
